Fede Gilles Website Project Starter Kit

This is how I start my websites projects. This starter file is a collection of things I have learned over the years, compiling assets from awesome people who I admire like Jesse Showalter, DesignCourse and so many others. This repo is for free use, hope you can use it too :D.

All images are property of Banana Paradox creative studio (Buenos Aires, Argentina | Date: 23/05/2019), free to use them as mockups but they are not available for profesional use.
